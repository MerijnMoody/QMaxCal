# QMaxCal Project

QMaxCal is a project designed for advanced optimization and plotting of quantum systems. This project includes utilities for generating and saving plots, as well as core optimization algorithms.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for plotting and other helper functions.
  - **optimizers.py**: Main optimization logic.
  - **types/**: Type definitions and interfaces used throughout the project.
  
- **results/**: Directory for storing generated plots and results.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the optimization scripts in `optimizers.py` to generate plots.

## Usage Guidelines

Refer to the documentation in the `results/README.md` for information on interpreting the saved plots.
